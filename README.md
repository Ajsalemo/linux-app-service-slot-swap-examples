# linux-app-service-slot-swap-examples

This repository contains examples for Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions for basic slot swapping.

To run these examples:
- Create either a Web App on App Service Linux or Web Apps for Container (Linux)
- Choose either GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps and use the associated code in the folder to deploy - use the GitHub Actions `.yaml` or the Azure DevOps `azure-pipelines.yml` as a reference for your pipeline.
